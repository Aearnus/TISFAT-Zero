TISFAT:Zero is a program made by Evar678 (Evar Smith), and Ipquarx (Ryan Froese); Two teenage programmers. TISFAT:Zero is designed to be a remake of the program TISFAT (referred to as TISFAT Original from now on), made by Noshbar. TISFAT Original's development stopped years ago. In 2012, Noshbar released the source code to it. A year later, in August, 2013, Evar678 and Ipquarx began work on TISFAT:Zero, in hopes of providing the community with a more stable, robust version of the program, and to take the roles as main developers of TISFAT.
